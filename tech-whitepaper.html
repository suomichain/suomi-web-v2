    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>Credit plays a critical role in all business activities. For example, in the financial industry, all financial regulatory activities and intermediaries, including product registration, securities issuance and trading, information disclosure and fund custody, are solutions to resolve the trust or asymmetric information issues. Another example is the supply chain management, which consists of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, consumers, etc.  To achieve the perfect coordination, the whole network needs trust. As a social problem that has always been difficult to solve, the current trust issue in commercial activities could be solved precisely by the blockchain technology at lower cost.</p>
    <p>As an infrastructure of the blockchain platform, which fully utilizes the characteristics of blockchain, such as decentralization, autonomy and unmodified information, SUOMI aims at further integrating the blockchain technology with business and social activities, and establishing a comprehensive fundamental for blockchain service platform. The applications of SUOMI are very broad. For instance, in the area of supply chain finance, the blockchain makes the data more open and transparent, which help the relevant enterprises and financial institutions to evaluate the assets and operation risks more accurately and to provide more customized support for business matching and fraud monitoring.  To streamline the implementation of the consortium blockchain, SUOMI provides integration capabilities to customize the transaction rules and consensus algorithm by on-chain governance.</p>
    <p>In addition, SUOMI will combine blockchain with edge intelligence technology to construct an infrastructure of Internet of Things, such as a distributed device network, which ran by a lot of equipments autonomously. The advantage of these technology combinations is that IoT devices could process large amounts of data generated by human or inhuman activities, which not only help enterprises solve the huge burden of cloud data operations in the Internet of Things era, but also make the devices themselves intelligent, known as artificial Intelligent Decentralized Autonomous Organization (AI DAO). The edge intelligence can adapt its own role in organizational activities through effective and timely processing of complex information and data to build a stable, secure, reliable and autonomous ecosystem.</p>

    <h1>1.Design Concept</h1>
    <h2>1.1 Blockchain</h2>
    <p>Almost all mechanisms in human society are centralized. Even after the Internet revolution, a large number of social activities were digitized, the centralized and trustworthy third parties dominated most of the peer-to-peer value delivery scenarios. The emerging of the blockchain has made it possible for both parties without a trust base to collaborate and complete the transfer of value without the assistance of a third party and is therefore considered as a potential solution to replace the current centralized system of the whole society.</p>
    <p>Blockchain originated in the underlying Bitcoin technology, which consists of a variety of technologies such as peer-to-peer network, distributed data storage, consensus mechanism, encryption algorithm and so on. As a distrusted and decentralized distributed ledger technology, blockchain has become a popular research topic in many industries in the past few years.</p>
    <h2>1.2 Design Background</h2>
    <p>Centralized systems dominate the public domain because of the requirements of high efficiency, which is also its competitive advantage compared with the corresponding decentralized systems. It can be said that with the maturity of the current blockchain technology, there is no sufficient capability for decentralized system to overtake the centralized system in most of the public service.
    Therefore, SUOMI believes that the blockchain, as the trust machine, will have more potential applications in 
    <ul>
    <li>non-public domain (such as enterprise alliances) </li>
    <li>public domain where the centralized system has fatal flaws (such as charities, lack of open and transparent information) </li>
    <li>new areas, e.g., unprofitable scenarios for middle-man or immature intermediaries such as IoT, artificial intelligence.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.3 Design Goal：Build a Global Blockchain Ecosystem</h2>
    <p>The design goal of SUOMI is to become the fundamental for building different types of blockchain in various scenarios, that is, to construct the underlying protocol of the blockchain in a SUOMI manner, which solves the security, scalability and privacy problems of the blockchain, and provides as many modules and plugins as possible in the application layer, and support popular high-level languages and tools to help individual developers or enterprises build, deploy, and run their smart contracts rapidly according to their own business needs.</p>

    <h1>2.Architecture and Technology</h1>
    <p>The design goal of SUOMI is to implement smart contracts that meet the needs of complex social activities through a distributed ledger and share the data in a highly customizable manner without mutual trust. In addition, SUOMI has the following characteristics:<p>
    <ol>
    <li>By separating the application layer and the core system, SUOMI simplify the development of platform applications</li>
    <li>Give developers more options to choose the right trading rules, forms of authorization, and consensus algorithms when creating a SuoDApp based on their business needs</li>
    <li>For the non-dependent transactions, the platform supports parallel transactions to improve block creation and verification speed</li>
    <li>Integrate state-of-the-art software architecture, consensus algorithms and trusted execution environment</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>2.1 Core Architecture</h2>
    <p>There are five key components for SUOMI architecture: </p>
    <ol>
    <li>A peer-to-peer network：Transfer messages between nodes</li>
    <li>Distributed Ledger: Store the list of ordered transactions</li>
    <li>Consensus Algorithm: Ensure the consistency and integrity of ordered transactions and resulting states</li>
    <li>Smart Contract Logic: Transaction execution</li>
    <li>Distributed Storage: Store the resulting states</li>
    </ol>
    <p>SUOMI adopts the “traditional” blockchain architecture as its core layer, including gossip protocol and a linked chain of cryptographically transaction blocks. Furthermore, SUOMI designs a modular consensus interface and a transaction processing engine to handle the different scenarios, threats and smart contracts. </p>
    <img class="architecture mb-5" src="/assets/images/architecture.gif" alt="architecture">
    <h3>2.1.1 Peer-to-Peer Network</h3>
    <p>The nodes in SUOMI pass the message over the TCP protocol in the network. The contents of the message include transactions, blocks, and other nodes in the network. These structured messages are all serialized using Google Protocol Buffers. By utilizing the gossip protocol, SUOMI not only decouples the network structure, separates the transaction order and transaction processing to optimize network performance and scalability, but also propagates transactions and blocks to all nodes in the network at the same time, ensuring the consistency and integrity of transaction data. This design is consistent with most public chains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>In order to meet the needs of enterprise-grade deployment, SUOMI supports network authentication at the P2P layer. By controlling the access list, SUOMI node can control:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Whether the node is allowed to connect to the network and can keep the current account status</li>
    <li>Whether the node allows sending the consensus information and participation in the consensus process.</li>
    <li>Whether the node can submit the transaction record in the network</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.1.2 Distributed Ledger</h3>
    <p>One of the most important features of blockchain and state machine approach is the ability to ensure that the network is consistent in its order. SUOMI, like traditional blockchain techniques, organizes the transaction logically into the "blockchain" data structure that contains an ordered list of encrypted blocks whose hash pointers point to the genesis block. Each block in the list contains an ordered list of transactions. The nodes agree on the order of transactions recorded in the ledger by the consensus algorithm.</p>
    <p>SUOMI does not require that each transaction be in strict order (that is, each transaction is before or after the other), and the transaction scheduler will allow transactions without dependencies to be executed parallelly. It also allows SUOMI to improve scalability and reduce storage requirements by partition and sharding.</p>
    <h3>2.1.3 Smart Contract</h3>
    <p>Smart contracts can be viewed as a state machine, which means the transaction from the distributed ledger could be input to the current snapshot of the state, and produce an output to update the state in the distributed ledger. This shows that the blockchain and the traditional state machine replication architecture is very similar. Blockchain uses this layer to implement business logic and domain capabilities for specific use cases.</p>
    <p>Because of its high security and scalability requirements, Bitcoin offers only very limited scripting languages ​​on smart contracts, and its blockchain is stateless, meaning there is no data storage in processing and can‘t run multi-phase execution. If the operation of the smart contract succeeds, the input is consumed and a new unspent output is created while if the operation fails, there is no change to the blockchain. This design addresses the non-functional needs of Bitcoin, but also makes some very simple contract rules infeasible.</p>
    <p>Ethereum extends the concept of smart contracts to deal with transactions on virtual machines. Smart contracts are written in high-level languages, such as Solidity, and compiled into binary code that can run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The logic of smart contract can be dynamically deployed across the blockchain via contract-wide broadcast. The operation code of contract can be used by network peers to verify transactions. Once the transaction is processed, the internal state of the smart contract is written to decentralized storage.</p>
    <p>SUOMI extends the concept of smart contracts to state machines, the "SUOMI Transaction Processing Engine”, also known as STPE. After inputting a series of distributed ledgers, the transaction will find the correct STPE to enter the valid transaction data along with the relevant pre-transaction status. SUOMI is also a model that supports both stateless UTXO (such as Bitcoin) and stateful (such as Ethereum).
    SUOMI allows developers to develop their own smart contracts in many popular languages, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Interpreted language: Python, JavaScript</li>
        <li>Compiled language: C + +, Go</li>
        <li>Virtual Machine: EVM, Java</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using these well-established programming languages, you can take advantage of existing tools to make static, dynamic, and formal analysis of contract codes.</p>
    <h3>2.1.4 Distributed Storage</h3>
    <p>Another important task that most blockchain applications need to address is how to ensure that states are consistent across the entire network, which is also an important goal of state machine replication. In Bitcoin’s blockchain, the status is a list of bitcoins that has not yet been spent, whereas the status managed by Ethereum includes the internal status of the balance of the native currency and the smart contract running on its network.</p>
    <p>SUOMI uses a method similar to Ethereum to store serialized contract states using radix Merkel tree. Each STPE is assigned to a namespace with write permission and can be serialized in a different way.</p>
    <h3>2.1.5 Consensus Algorithm</h3>
    <p>Consensus is a process that allows network nodes to agree on the order and outcome of the transaction. Most consensus algorithms fall into two categories:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Lottery system: This is a mechanism that select a leader with accounting rights. The leader proposes a new block and inform other nodes acknowledge it. Compared with the voting system, the scalability of this method is good, which can be used in a large-scale network while the disadvantage is that this algorithm is highly likely make the situation that two leaders proposed different blocks. It takes a longer time to solve the forks. The typical lottery-based algorithms are PoW, PoS and DPoS.</li>
    <li>Voting: This system requires each node to transfer information to other nodes for multiple rounds of voting, so the more nodes in the network, the longer it takes to reach a consensus. Compared with lottery system, voting has the advantage of finality, which means much easier to reach a final agreement. The core design principle of the algorithm is how to balance scalability and efficiency. The typical examples of this category are Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (for malicious nodes) and Raft (for no malicious nodes).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Because each consensus algorithm has its own unique applications and properties (such as network size, throughput, fault tolerance), SUOMI only provides consensus algorithm interface and gives the developers the option to choose the appropriate consensus algorithm. SUOMI has implemented or planned to provide the following consensus algorithms:</p>

        <td>Vote for a leader to publish the new block</td>
        <td>Any environments (no BFT)</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <h2>2.2 Technologies</h2>
    <p>By summarizing the application scenarios, SUOMI is designed to be a highly modular, high throughput and high security framework with a variety of unique mechanisms, so that developers and enterprises can easily target their business requirements on the platform to build their applications.</p>
    <h3>2.2.1 Simplify the Application Development and Deployment</h3>
    <p>The architecture of SUOMI divides the system's core layer and the smart contract layer into clear boundaries, which are abstracted through smart contracts, allowing developers to write SuoDApps in many popular languages.</p>
    <p>SUOMI Smart Contract Development Platform (SCDP) supports a growing number of popular languages, including Java, Python, JavaScript, Go, C++, and provides a set of trading libraries containing a large number of underlying functions as a template for developer to use. The development platform also supports JSON as a standard data format and uses the REST API to interact with the client.</p>
    <h3>2.2.2 Permissioning</h3>
    <p>The developers can deploy private chains based on their private keys. Transaction information in private chain is completely independent. The administrators of private chain have member management interface that allow them to determine the access level of information in the private chain through roles and authentication.</p>
    <h3>2.2.3 Parallel Transaction Execution</h3>
    <p>A typical single-threaded blockchain requires each transaction execute in an order. SUOMI expanded its mechanism based on the single-thread model.  The transaction scheduler will split non-dependent transactions into different processing streams for parallel execution. With the prerequisite to prevent the double-spent issues, several transactions were executed at the same time to accelerate the creation and verification of the blocks on chain.</p>
    <h3>2.2.4 Distributed Governance</h3>
    <p>SUOMI allows the on-chain change management through a specific transaction library "On-chain Configuration", which covers the decisions like whether to change the consensus algorithm or change the transaction engine (STPE). "On-chain Configuration" supports two different modes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Administrator mode: the system administrator can modify the settings of blockchain after authorization and authentication directly.</li>
    <li>Community mode: community members vote for a policy. When most of nodes agree on the new policy, the changes blockchain configuration will be executed.</li>
    </ol>


    <h1>3. Key Technologies</h1>
    <p>The key technologies of SUOMI include FastPoW, highly expressive and safe smart contract, and SUOMI Transaction Processing Engine (STPE).</p>
    <h2>3.1 Fast Proof of Work (FastPoW）</h2>
    <p>According to the design goal of SUOMI, FastPoW consensus algorithm can handle more than 1000 transactions per second, the workflow is shown as follows (the flow chart is on the next page):</p>
    <ol>
    <li>First, candidates that meet the election eligibility in the network are selected through a Verifiable Random Generator (VRG)</li>
    <li>Then, each candidate node gets a randomly elected time from the VRG</li>
    <li>The candidate nodes with the shortest time of random elected time will be named the leader of this round, who also have the rights to publish the new block to the ledgers, and obtain the corresponding token reward.</li>
    <li>After completing the accounting, the leader node requests a random waiting time through the random number generator, and the node must spend a random waiting time to obtain the candidate again to avoid taking the advantage of successive publishing blocks.</li>
    </ol>
    <img class="ml-0 mt-4 mb-5 desktop-img" src="assets/images/fastpow.gif" alt="fast proof of work">

    <p>FastPoW offers a fair leadership election through VRG, avoiding heavy energy-consuming work competition among a large number of nodes. FastPoW which develops the Nakamoto's POW algorithm in an eco-friendly manner, includes several key features:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Fair and reliable: All participants should have equal opportunities for participation</li>
    <li>Reasonable return on investment: The cost of the leader election process should be much lower than the value the leader can generate</li>
    <li>Simple verification: Each participant can easily verify whether leaders are legally elected.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>3.1.1 Verified Random Function Generator</h3>
    <p>Since most of the blockchain consensus algorithms are using random numbers to solve the randomness issue, obtaining a random number that is difficult to predict and control is the core of the validity of consensus algorithm.</p>
    <p>After extensive research, the traditional random number generation issues have been solved well, but it does not completely solve the problem to let participants verify the result of random number generation in decentralized environment.</p>
    <p>SUOMI verifiable random number generator (VRG) constructs a generic dice based on the Verifiable Random Functions (VRF). Suomi uses the random numbers generated by VRG multiple times to determine the results of election and the waiting time for the restricted nodes. The simple introduction of VRF describes as follows:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>There is a function F, the node can use its own private key pk and want to deliver the information x, as a random number input, and the output is random number r and proof of x.</li>
    <div class="text-center mt-2 mb-2"><i>(r, proof<sub>x</sub>)=f<sub>s</sub>(x, pk)</i></div>
    <li>Other nodes can verify that the random number r that comes from F by using the ppk’s corresponding public key pbk and the proof of x.</li>
    <li>The difference between a digital signature and VRF is that VRF has one and only one output.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are many ways to construct the function of VRF. Currently, SUOMI uses verifiable random numbers based on polynomial interpolation . By using blocks to construct F to simplify calculation, the construction process is briefly described as follows:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Each node <i>block<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>block<sub>2</sub></i> ... <i>block<sub>n</sub></i> constructs a polynomial 
    <div class="text-center mt-2 mb-2"><i>A(X)=a<sub>0</sub>+ a<sub>1</sub>x + ... + a<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub><sup>n</sup></i></div>
    based on the hash values of the nearest n blocks so that the polynomial curve can pass through each hash pair <i>(block<sub>i</sub>, block<sub>j</sub>)</i> to obtain polynomial coefficients such that each node generates a random number r and proof according to the polynomial <i>block<sub>j</sub> = A(block<sub>i</sub>)</i>.</li>
    <li>If a node suspects the result of a random number generated by another node, it is only needs to substitute r and proof into the function A (x) to verify the results.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3.1.2 Registration Phase</h3>
    <p>SUOMI nodes are divided into general nodes, candidate nodes, leader nodes and restricted nodes. New nodes in the network or restricted nodes that have been elected as leaders must register its pbk during the registration phase to become the candidate nodes. Here are the steps during registration phase:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>A node in the network downloads a client that contains a verifiable random number generator (VRG), a service authorization certificate (SPID), and the recent R blocks in the chain to qualify as candidates on the blockchain .</li>
    <li>After becoming a candidate, the node obtains the encrypted a digital signature through a random number generator (VRG) and a public-private key (PPK & PSK)</li>
    <div class="text-center mt-2 mb-2"><i>sealedSignature=seal_data(PPK|PSK|SRGID)</i></div>
    <li>Finally, the candidate's public key PPK will be uploaded to the candidate list.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The main data structure used in this process is as follows:</p>
        <pre>
        Signature {
            byte[64] srgId
            byte[64] ppk
            byte[64] psk
            double sealedSignature
        }

        Candidate {
            byte[64] ppk
            date requestTime
        }

        CandidateList {
            List<Candidate> candidates
        }</pre>


    <h3>3.1.3 Election Phase</h3>
    <p>During the election phase, the nodes broadcast information that contains the public key PPK of the candidate node. The procedure is as follows:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Each candidate node generates a random elected time counter from VRG with their own digital signatures</li>
    <div class="text-center mt-2 mb-2"><i>(electingTime, PPK)=randomElectingTime(H(B<sup>r-n</sup>), sealedSignature)</i></div>
    <li>When electingTime countdown is over and no elected information received, the candidate node packs the proposed submission of the block automatically and obtain the certificate of election in the whole network broadcast</li>
    <div class="text-center mt-2 mb-2"><i>(electedCertificate, PPK)=createElectedCertificate(B<sub>proposed</sub>), sealedSignature)</i></div>
    <li>If there are two certificates in the network, the earlier of election time on the certificate won. </li>
    <li>If the result of this round voting will not be able to be determined even after exceeding the time limit. This round of voting will be over and the new round of voting will start.</li>
    <li>If the candidate node has received the information of the other candidates and its proposed block during the countdown of electingTime, it will verify whether the leader is legally elected</li>
    <ol>
    <li>If the leader is legally elected, the candidate nodes break the current countdown and waiting for the next election phase.</li>
    <li>If the leader is not legally elected, the candidate node continues the current countdown.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>
    <p>The main data structure used in this process is as follows:</p>
        <pre>
        ElectedCertificate {
            byte[64] ppk
            date electedTime
            byte[64] blockProposed
        }

        Leader {
            byte[64] ppk
            date electedTime
            double waitTime
        }</pre>

    <h3>3.1.4 Restricted Phase</h3>
    <p>After publishing the block, the leader will be transformed to a restricted node and waits for a random period of time before obtaining the rights to register as a candidate node again. The procedure is as follows:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>When the leader submits a new block on the blockchain and gets the approval of the entire network, it will receive token reward and become a restricted node for a period of time. At this moment, the node needs to request VRG again for a random waiting time to decide the next election time.</li>
    <div class="text-center mt-2 mb-2"><i>idleTime=randomIdleTime(electedCertificate, sealedSignature)</i></div>
    <li>When the restricted node passes the idleTime, it will become a normal node again. In this case, the candidate node may be registered again, see 3.1.1</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The main data structure used in this process is as follows:</p>
        <pre>
        IdleTime {
            byte[64] ppk
            double duration
        }

        Restricted {
            byte[64] ppk
            byte[64] sealedSignature
            IdleTime idleTime
        }

        General {
            byte[64] ppk
            date creationTime
        }

        GeneralList {
            List<General> generals
        }</pre>
    <h3>3.1.5 Security Consideration</h3>
    <p>The ultimate goal of lottery-based consensus algorithms, such as PoW and PoS, is to ensure that random number generation is completely random, which means no one can predict the next selected node, and not able to be destroyed by malicious nodes. Since no definitive solution to this problem could be found, the following options are currently available for SUOMI to ensure the fairness of the election process:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>From the perspective of economy，the malicious nodes  has no incentives<sup>1</sup> to crack the system because of the high cost.</li>
    <li>Eliminate malicious nodes via external dependencies such as provisioning in consortium chains or by hardware, e.g. trusted execution environment (TEE)</li>
    <li>Use a verifiable random function to enable the other nodes verify the validity of random number came from the valid random function</li>
    <li>Verify the distribution of random numbers, for instance, verifying the distribution of leader among networks. This method is usually adopted with other methods because of the post-verification, the significance level alpha can be determined by voting on the blockchain or the decision of the administrator. The sample code to perform the test is below</li>
    </ol>
    <pre>
        observation = expection = blockListSize=0
        ForEach (ppk, totalParticipants) in blockArray:
            blockListSize += 1
            expectation += 1 / totalParticipants

        if ppk is equal to validatingIdentifier:
            observation += 1
            if observation > minObservation and observation > expectation:
                p = expectation / blockListSize
                delta = sqrt(blockListSize * p (1.0 - p))
                value = (observation - expectation) / delta
                if value > max:
                    return False
        return True</pre>
    <p>SUOMI leaves the decision of consensus algorithm completely to the developer. For example, FastPoW has two versions that support different hardware environments. on the consortium chain, one can choose FastPoW algorithms without any hardware requirements, while choose the TEE support of FastPoW algorithm on the public chain.</p>  
    <p style="font-size: 11px;"><sup>1</sup>At present, there is an algorithm called Algorand, which is similar to the PoS, claims that the fairness can be achieved in terms of cryptography without using economic incentives. The main idea is to select a small number of proposers based on the lottery mechanism and utilize PBFT to reach a consensus among those proposers. SUOMI will pay close attention to the progress of this consensus algorithm and update SUOMI consensus algorithm module according to its maturity.</p>

    <h2>3.2 Expressive and Safety Smart Contract</h2>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, design a highly expressive and safety smart contract is not easy task in the field of distributed ledgers. Therefore, the other important design goal of SUOMI is to allow the platform to run smart contracts safely and fulfil the complicated business requirements. The figure below is a comparison between SUOMI smart contract architecture and a traditional one:</p>
    <img class="ml-0 mt-3 desktop-img" src="assets/images/contract.gif" alt="Highly Expressive and Safe Smart Contract">

    <p>The proposed solution is to decouple the transactional logic layer by domain. Compared with the design of a common transaction logic layer, this approach can be used to address the area of security threats through specific rules. SUOMI calls this domain-specific business rule “transaction library”, which provides a highly restrictive and expressive package of business logic in the domain.</p>

    <h3>3.2.1 Transaction Libraries</h3>
    <p>There are many forms of transaction libraries. SUOMI allows developers to choose the complexity of the transaction libraries, such as a simple logic to verify business format or complex virtual machine running smart contracts.</p>
    <p>The design of smart contracts needs to balance the contract's functionality and security. However, if the trading engine is only for a particular area, it would be relatively easy to limit the contract's behavior on the blockchain to improve security. From this point of view, SUOMI has designed the transaction libraries for smart contract languages to help developers develop, test, and validate use cases rapidly. The first phase of SUOMI provides the following transaction libraries:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>User Registry</li>
        <li>Hello World</li>
        <li>Supply Chain</li>
        <li>AI DAO</li>
        <li>SmiEth</li>
        <li>On-chain Configuration</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Users can build their own transaction libraries to meet the unique needs of their business. Taking the consortium chain of financial markets as an example. All parties in the alliance can make detailed specification on the data formats and behaviors that the transaction library can operate. The operation may cause illegal and inappropriate consequence could be excluded.</p>
    <h3>Sample Transaction Library: Block Explorer</h3>
    <p>Transaction processing engine consists of two parts: transaction processor and business logic. SDK is responsible for the blockchain transaction processing part while the latter is provided by the transaction libraries. This section describes the transaction libraries while generic SDK will be described in detail in the next section of the trading engine.</p>
    <p>Take block explorer as an example. The block info could store the following information: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The most recent block id in the list</li>
        <li>The oldest block id in the list</li>
        <li>The block id to be queried in the list</li>
        <li>The tolerance of the network sync</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These values can be stored in the following data structure:</p>
        <pre>
            message BlockInfoConfig {
                uint64 latest_block = 1;
                uint64 oldest_block = 2;
                uint64 target_count = 3;
                uint64 sync_tolerance = 4;
            }</pre>
    <p>Transaction payload data structure is as follows:</p>
        <pre>
            message BlockInfoTxn {
                BlockInfo new_block = 1;
                uint64 target_count = 2;
                uint64 sync_tolerance = 3;
            }</pre>
    <h2>3.3 SUOMI Transaction Processing Engine（STPE）</h2>
    <p>SUOMI Transaction Processing Engine (STPE) supports stateless UTXO and stateful models. It also supports both Ethereum Smart Contracts via EVM and SDKs that allow developers to develop their own smart contracts in many popular programming languages. The architecture of STPE is shown as below.</p>
    <p>SUOMI Transaction Processing Engine offers a wide range of SDKs, provides RESTful APIs and supports JSON format and also the formal analysis of smart contracts.</p>
    <h2>3.3.1 Java SDK</h2>
    <p>STPE consists of two major components: transaction processor and business logic. The SDK mainly includes the general blockchain transaction processing part and the business logic part is provided by the domain transaction libraries. The transaction libraries have been introduced in the previous section, so this section mainly uses the JAVA SDK as an example for illustration. Other SDKs are designed with similar principles.</p>
    <p>The SDK interacts with the transaction library in two ways:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><i>Apply</i> Method</li>
    <li><i>Metadata</i> Method</li>
    </ol>

    <p><i>Apply</i> method is invoked through the business request and state store. In general, it has four steps:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Unpack the trading instructions</li>
    <li>Get data from the context manager</li>
    <li>Execute the transaction</li>
    <li>Save the updated data</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The second way is through <i>Metadata</i> method interacts with the transaction libraries. The metadata is used for registration of the trading engine while the registration includes the type of transaction will be processed. </p>

    <p>Transaction data can be divided into two parts: headers and payloads. The header contains a signature of the current trader, while payload contains the compression of the transaction data, such as transaction name, action, resource usage and external data dependencies.</p>
    
    <p>The next step is to save the status of the transaction. First, we need to encrypt the data, and then save the encrypted data to the transaction's address. Finally, we show the process of the encoding and decoding of data. </p>

    <h3>3.3.2 RESTful API</h3>
    <p>SUOMI supports the RESTful API to facilitate the integration of third-party wallets or block explorers for the establishment of the ecosystem. </p>

    <h1>4. SUOMI Applications</h1>
    <p>Blockchain and next-generation information technologies such as cloud computing, big data, the Internet of things, 5G, artificial intelligence, have full potential to integrate together to create a new economy area. The application scenarios are very broad.</p>
    <h2>4.1 Supply Chain Finance</h2>
    <p>Supply chain finance refers to financing various parties in the supply chain through different financing instruments, which balance the liquidity gap between buyers and sellers and minimize the total costs of supply chain. Because of the large number of participants in the supply chain, including raw materials suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers. The complex network structure consists of logistics, information and capital flow. Additionally, the data and information in the supply chain operation are generated from different sources. The information is invisible or unclear. For example, banks can‘t see the original contract between enterprises and verify the use of funds. This kind of issues make the banks only provide prepayment or inventory financing for first level suppliers. Therefore, a large number of second or third level suppliers/ distributors are very difficult to obtain funds from the traditional financial channels and push them to higher interest funds through other channels, which limits the development speed of small and medium-size enterprises. It also limits the areas of supply chain financial services.</p>
    <p>By utilizing SUOMI platform, the alliance between enterprises and financial institutions can set effective business rules and eliminate illegal and malicious operations on the blockchain based on the transaction libraries,  such as digitizing warehouse receipts, contracts and bills on the supply chain and regulating the transfer. After that, digitized assets can play a self-evident role in the whole process, which reduces a lot of manpower and resources to test the authenticity of the transaction and the cost of risk control. Therefore, the transaction speed and cost will be much lower than the traditional centralized banking system.</p>
    <h2>4.2 Peer-to-Peer Device Network</h2>
    <p>As an extended network based on the Internet, the Internet of Things (IoT) relied on a centralized server model historically.  This model can no longer meet the growing needs in the near future due to the high cost. The trends of decentralized IoT pattern is imperative.</p>
    <p>Through peer-to-peer networking technology, IoT deals with the communication between different devices and distributes the computing and storage needs from the original centralized server to a large number of equipments, which coordinates through blockchain, to cut costs significantly.</p>
    <h2>4.3 Charities</h2>
    <p>In the past few years, social charities and lotteries have been frequently questioned by the public about the usage of funds. As an industry that relies on information transparency for its credibility, the current mode of social welfare requires an urgent transformation. Based on the distributed ledger technology, blockchain enables each donor to fully understand the distribution of the fund, which can be an excellent tool to improve the public trust. It is also applicable to complex business scenarios such as directed donation and conditional donation.</p>

    <h1>5. Conclusion</h1>
    <p>After analyzing the current blockchain project implementation, SUOMI project summarized the most important technical needs and proposed the following solution:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Separation of the core system and application layer of the blockchain, SUOMI design the transaction processing engine to improve the efficiency, scalability and portability of the smart contract.</li>
    <li>SUOMI hands over the choice of consensus algorithms to developers, providing only algorithmic implementation and pluggable interfaces to meet the needs of the different types of blockchains.</li>
    <li>Through the accumulation of the industry practice, SUOMI formed a huge knowledge base and made the smart contract fulfil the complex needs of different industries without sacrificing security. It also makes an important step to standardize the blockchain application in different industries.</li>
